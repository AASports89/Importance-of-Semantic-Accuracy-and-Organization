# **Organize HTML Semantics** [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](#isc-license)

## Overview 
---
Improving the organization of provided code, ensures a smooth operating webpage and/or application.

**Refactoring** existing code to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology will the technique used to improve the **Horiseon** webpage.

> **Important**: When working with someone else's code, you should adhere to the **Scout Rule**&mdash;always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

The main goal of **Refractoring** is too improve the accessibility of the **Horiseon** webpage for all users across the board. Specifically, the utilization of semantics for the ```HTML``` and ```CSS``` source codes will improve the navigation capability of the website for all users.

## Acceptance Criteria
---
> **Note:** The following criteria is used to determine if the standards set for the **Horiseon** webpage have been met:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up
